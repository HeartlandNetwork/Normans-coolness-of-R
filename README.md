# normans-coolness-of-R

Building off the extended examples from Norman Matloff's classic book, the Art of R Programming, with the objectives being: 1) to achieve oneness with R and 2) to explore various publicly available datasets using Matloff's examples of statistical programming. In the second book, the Art of Machine Learning, Matloff uses R to explore the world of machine learning. The purpose is "...to explain the how and why of machine learning." My goal with this second book is to experiment with the code and to apply it to other widely available datasets.
